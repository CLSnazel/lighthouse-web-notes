### W1D1
So far we have learned many things about how this bootcamp will run! There are 5 important rules to follow as we continue forward:

1. Always ask for help.
    - especially if you're spending more than 15 minutes on a problem.
    - There is a lot of support available. The internet, you peers, LHL mentors and instructors

2. Put in the time.
    - Normal commitment time for the program is 9am-9pm 6+ days a week. It's brutal, but if you can do this, you can do anything!
3. Take breaks and sleep!
    - While this bootcamp is super instense, we must get proper conscious and unconscious breaks to keep our sanity in check :)
4. Don't compare yourself to others!
    - The success of others is never a reflection of your weakness. Cheer them on and use them as inspiration for yourself!
    - Everyone in the bootcamp has their own strengths, and are coming in with different experience levels. You are valid, and your own commitment to the bootcamp is what maters the most.
5. Be comfortable with getting uncomfortable.
    - The curriculum moves very quickly, and sometimes topics will change before we have a full grasp. It is best to roll with the punches and stay on our toes, even if we don't feel 100% ready!
